Our Project Objectives

The central objective of this project is to reach out to millions of farmers of India using social media and machine learning.

What is Agriculture Extension

Agriculture extension is vital to disseminate information on new agriculture techniques and agronometric practicies among the farmers. Even if we develop the best varieties of seeds but if we are not able to disseminate its information amongst the farmers, it can hardly have any impact. Once the farmers come to know about the advanced seed, only then will they demand it and use it. Also just using the seed may not be sufficient. It may need a different way of applying fertilizers or different watering time. The farmer needs to know about all this, and hence the value of extension.

Current Agriculture Extension Mechanism

Given the agriculture sector scenario in Pakistan, extension becomes a very challenging task. There are millions of small and marginal farmers and landless labor - their awareness levels are low, many live in remote areas and so on.

Traditionally our extension workers and field officers visit the fields and interact with farmers invillages and provide them training & advisory on best practices in farming and aspects of agriculture. Additionally, various training programs are organized by various agencies under the various schemes run by the agriculture department the details of which can be found at the department’s website.

In recent years, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) has begun to be actively used in agriculture extension. Some of the ICT based channels are:

Farmers’ Portal: which is a central repository of all the information required by farmers at all stages at one location.

Kisan Call Centres: where a toll free number 1800-180-1551 is available for farmers to query in regional languages. The system maintains a huge information and receives over 5 lakh calls per month across India.

mKisan: which is used to send sms advisories by Agriculture Officers and Experts to farmers and other registered users in hindi or English or regional languages.

KisanSuvidha Mobile App (available on Google Play): which provides all information that a farmer would need from sowing stage to post harvesting including market prices and weather alerts on their mobile. It has been downloaded over 1 lakh times and average user rating is 4.3/5 based on about 2800 ratings.

### Farmers on Internet There are about 14 crore farmers in Pakistan. Most of us believe farmers don't use internet. So why bother with this? But the situation might be changing silently right under our nose (and may already have changed!)...

As per the latest report by The Internet and Mobile Association of Pakistan (IAMAI), there are already about 11 crore people in rural India who are accessing internet via their mobiles (not just mobile, but mobile internet!). However, the reality means more than this.

There would be many more rural-to-urban migrants who are working in cities in the unorganized sector but have a family farm back in village cultivated by their family members. Also since an average rural household holds less number of mobiles than an average urban household, we are actually looking at a good percentage of rural households being on internet.

Change is Already Happening

In fact, many farmers have already started creating local groups and started using them to get better terms for their business.

The Changing Landscape

The present change is being driven by 3 factors

Cheaper smartphones

Cheaper and faster data with wider coverage

Localization of internet i.e. development of audio/visual content in local languages

With these 3 factors in operation, a lot of farmers will soon be on internet and social media. Our task is simple... to tap them!

We must develop content which is meaningful for them so that they engage with us. If we are able to achieve this, this would be a big step forward in terms of capcity building of our extension mechanism.

The AgriBot Project

This agribot project is one element of the tasks highlighted above. Presently we receive around 5 lakh calls on our call center every month. This shows that our farmers want relevant information today and are willing to ask for it. However, expanding call centers is very expensive and requires huge capacity building.
